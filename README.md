lw
========

The lw program lists all existing acme windows. The output is sorted according to the following criteria, in order:

1. whether the window is clean
2. whether it is corresponding to a file on disk
3. the file modtime

As usual with acme, if lw is run from the tag bar, the output goes to the Errors window.
